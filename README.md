# password-generator
this little program makes strings of random characters you can use as passwords <br />
in the 'settings' tab, you can choose what types of characters to include in the passwords (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols) <br />
click the password to copy it, or save it to a txt file to use it later :D <br />

this does use PySimpleGUI so you'll need a licence to run it :/ <br />
i also wanted to make a build of it but PyInstaller and cx_Freeze aren't working for me idk why
