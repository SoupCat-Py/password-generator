# password-generator
this little program makes strings of random characters you can use as passwords <br />

- in the 'settings' tab, you can choose what types of characters to include in the passwords (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols) <br />
- choose how many characters you want the password to be using the dropdown menu on the right <br />
- click the password to copy it, or save it to a txt file to use it later :D <br />

press ENTER/RETURN to generate <br />
press ESC to close the app <br />

this does use PySimpleGUI so you'll need to install it and then get a licence to run it :/ <br />
i also wanted to make a build of it but PyInstaller and cx_Freeze aren't working for me idk why
